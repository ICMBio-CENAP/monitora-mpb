# then rerun it with thin = 10, thin = 100, ... to examine how the

# explore MCMC convergence for beta-parameters (species niches) and
# V-parameters (variation in species niches)

# first examine the effective size of the posterior sample.
# As there are two chains with a sample of 100 from each, the actual sample size is 200
# Thus, ideally the effective sample size would be 200 as well
# But in presence of autocorrelation, the effective sample size will be lower than the actual sample size
ess.beta <- effectiveSize(mpost$Beta)
ess.beta
# our model contains x*y beta-parameters (x for each of the y species)
# Thus we have x*y effective sample sizes to look at. This is best done with a histogram
hist(ess.beta, xlab = expression("Effective sample size" ~ beta ~ ""))

# As ess.V has fewer entries, we just look at it directly instead of drawing a histogram
ess.V <- effectiveSize(mpost$V)

# we did not used Phylo so there is no Rho
#ess.rho = effectiveSize(mpost$Rho)
#ess.rho

# we then examine the Gelman diagnostics, i.e. the Potential scale reduction factors
# this diagnostic compares if different chains (here we have 2 chains) give consistent results
# ideally the value of this diagnostic would be close to one
# as you increase thinning, you should observe the values getting closer to one
